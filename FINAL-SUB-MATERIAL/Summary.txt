This video shows the Bluefoot, a quaduped robot, balancing a mass (about the same size and weight of a cup of coffee) on its trunk (main body) so as to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller in achieving a steady trunk orientation. The video shows that the mass remains balanced only when the controller is active. When deactivated, the mass falls almost immediately as the robot begins to walk.
