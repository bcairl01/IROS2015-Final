A video of the simulated robot has been submitted along with this paper. This video shows the robot balancing a mass (about the same size and weight of a cup of coffee) on its top platform (trunk) so as to depict the effectiveness of the controller in achieving a steady trunk orientation. The video shows that the mass remains balanced only when the controller is active. When deactivated, the mass falls almost immediately as the robot begins to walk.
